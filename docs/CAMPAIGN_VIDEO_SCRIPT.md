## OPENING SCENE (0:00 - 0:20)

**[VISUAL: Warm, sunlit living room. An elderly woman (LOLA, 72) looks at a photo album with her grandchild]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
*"Every photo tells a story... a wedding day, a first birthday, a family reunion. These aren't just images—they're our most precious memories."*

## THE PROBLEM (0:20 - 1:00)

**[VISUAL: Split screen - warm family photos vs. cold, digital data streams]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
*"But in today's digital world, our photos have become more than memories. They've become data—valuable data that companies use to train artificial intelligence."*

**[VISUAL: Simple animation showing how photos are collected and used by AI]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
*"Every photo you share online contains hidden information: your location, your daily routines, your family members' faces. AI systems can use this to recognize you, track you, and even create fake images of you."*

**[VISUAL: Statistic cards appearing]**

- "78% of seniors are concerned about AI privacy"
- "3.2 billion photos are shared online every day"
- "65% of people don't know their photos are being used for AI training"

**LOLA:**
*"I had no idea... I just wanted to share pictures with my family."*
